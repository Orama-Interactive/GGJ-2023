#: src/Menu/menu.tscn

msgstr ""

#: src/Menu/menu.tscn
msgid "What was special about this tree was its seeds."
msgstr ""

#: src/Menu/menu.tscn
msgid "With a single blow of the wind, its seeds would scatter through the air"
msgstr ""

#: src/Menu/menu.tscn
msgid "And fly far far away, looking for a place to root."
msgstr ""

#: src/Menu/menu.tscn
msgid "This is the story of one of those seeds."
msgstr ""

#: src/Level.tscn
msgid "The seed flew away, through a forest with big spruce trees."
msgstr ""

#: src/Level.tscn
msgid "Navigating its way through the forest, the seed had to avoid the treetops."
msgstr ""

#: src/Level.tscn
msgid "“This forest is way too dense” the seed thought. “I won’t be able to root properly here, with so little sun reaching the forest bed.”"
msgstr ""

#: src/Level.tscn
msgid "Suddenly, a cracking sound scared the little seed."
msgstr ""

#: src/Level.tscn
msgid "“Why are the trees falling out of nowhere? Maybe that’s my chance to root!”"
msgstr ""

#: src/Level.tscn
msgid "“But what will happen when I root and I become a tree myself? Will I fall like those trees are?”"
msgstr ""

#: src/Level.tscn
msgid "The forest became less and less dense the further the seed traveled."
msgstr ""

#: src/Level.tscn
msgid "“What could have caused such a catastrophe?” The seed thought."
msgstr ""

#: src/Level.tscn
msgid "“I need to travel further, it's not safe here!”"
msgstr ""

#: src/Level.tscn
msgid "But after a while things became even weirder. The forest lost its colours and the surroundings got very noisy."
msgstr ""

#: src/Level.tscn
msgid "“There’s barely any soil here, how will I find a place to root?” The seed thought as it traversed through that gray looking forest."
msgstr ""

#: src/Level.tscn
msgid "It was getting more and more difficult for the seed to navigate between this place's obstacles but it was determined to find the perfect spot to root, so it carried on."
msgstr ""

#: src/Level.tscn
msgid "After some time, the seed realized that this place isn't suitable for a tree to live there either."
msgstr ""

#: src/Level.tscn
msgid "The seed was tired, but determined, so it went even further."
msgstr ""

#: src/Level.tscn
msgid "“This place really has no end” it thought. But it was abruptly interrupted by a sound. A scary sound unlike any other."
msgstr ""

#: src/Level.tscn
msgid "And everything was calm."
msgstr ""

#: src/Level.tscn
msgid "The forest was long gone."
msgstr ""

#: src/Level.tscn
msgid "The seed felt scared and alone. Everything, even the sky, looked so hostile."
msgstr ""

#: src/Level.tscn
msgid "“I can’t go on for much longer. It’s so cold and lonely out here.”"
msgstr ""

#: src/Level.tscn
msgid "After all this way it had traveled the poor seed had no strength left within it. Even the air stopped supporting its journey. The seed was for the first time truly alone."
msgstr ""

#: src/Level.tscn
msgid "The end."
msgstr ""

#: src/ending.tscn
msgid "But Grandpa! What happened next?"
msgstr ""

#: src/ending.tscn
msgid "The conflicts of the humans left fire and blood at their trails."
msgstr ""

#: src/ending.tscn
msgid "Hope was naught but a faint light, yet wars were in humanity’s nature, never to be stopped."
msgstr ""

#: src/ending.tscn
msgid "But nature itself would decay, for with each war life as a whole would be more and more in danger."
msgstr ""

#: src/ending.tscn
msgid "- And what happened to the seed? Did it fall to the ground? Did it manage to root?"
msgstr ""

#: src/ending.tscn
msgid "No, it did not manage to root. Not every story has to have a good ending you know!"
msgstr ""

#: src/ending.tscn
msgid "Then I don't like this story!"
msgstr ""

#: src/ending.tscn
msgid "I'm glad you said that."
msgstr ""

#: src/ending.tscn
msgid "You see."
msgstr ""

#: src/ending.tscn
msgid "This story and stories like that is the root of all our problems."
msgstr ""

#: src/ending.tscn
msgid "It was supposed to only contain dark truths."
msgstr ""

#: src/ending.tscn
msgid "Truths that make us desperate."
msgstr ""

#: src/ending.tscn
msgid "Truths that make us give up all hope."
msgstr ""

#: src/ending.tscn
msgid "Truths that are capable of killing each and every seed of hope left within us."
msgstr ""

#: src/ending.tscn
msgid "But dark truths are only half the truth."
msgstr ""

#: src/ending.tscn
msgid "And sometimes even less."
msgstr ""

#: src/ending.tscn
msgid "Be careful, for the world is full of half truths like this."
msgstr ""

#: src/ending.tscn
msgid "But they do not really represent us, they just sound believable and dark enough to paralyze our efforts of something brighter."
msgstr ""

#: src/ending.tscn
msgid "We already have the seeds of hope from the ones that came before us in our own hearts."
msgstr ""

#: src/ending.tscn
msgid "Now we have to choose the endings to the stories we believe in"
msgstr ""

#: src/ending.tscn
msgid "for those seeds to really root for the ones who will come after."
